    ARTIFY GALLERY JAVA PROJECT SYNOPSIS

Project Title: 
Artify Gallery – Console-Based Java CRUD MVC Application

Objective: 
The project demonstrates how to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a structured Java application using the MVC (Model–View–Controller) pattern. It simulates an art gallery management system where users can manage artworks, artists, and exhibitions through a simple console interface.

Scope:
•	Manage records of artworks (id, title, category, description).
•	Maintain artist details (name, id, bio).
•	Organize exhibitions (theme, date, id, name).
•	Provide CRUD functionality for each module via console menus.
•	No database layer — data is stored in memory using Java collections (e.g., ArrayList).

Architecture (MVC):
•	Model: Plain Old Java Objects representing entities (Artwork, Artist, Exhibition).
•	View: Console menus and text-based input/output for user interaction.
•	Controller: Handles user requests, invokes model operations, and updates the view.
•	
Features:
1.	Artwork Management – Add Artwork, List Artwork, Update Artwork, Delete Artwork.
2.	Artist Management –Add Artist, List Artist, Update Artist, Delete Artist.
3.	Exhibition Management – Add exhibitions, List exhibition, update exhibition, delete exhibitions.

Technology Stack:
•	Language: Java
•	Architecture: MVC pattern
•	Tools: Eclipse 
•	Version Control:GitHub

Outcome: 
The project provides a practical demonstration of CRUD operations in Java using MVC principles 
without database complexity. It highlights modular design, separation of concerns, and user 
interaction through a console interface.
